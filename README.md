# Implementations
Implementations of various standard C++ classes for educational purposes.

These implementations represent the fledgling efforts of a self taught programmer to further his knowledge and understanding of C++.

## Warning:  
This repository will undoubtedly contain:
- numerous errors
- examples of bad practice
- poor design

The path toward knowledge is littered with mistakes and failures.  I hope to fail often and spectacularly.
